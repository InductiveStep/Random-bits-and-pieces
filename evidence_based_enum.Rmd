That feeling when you want to see the 648 permutations of the words "evidence", "based", "policy", and "making", conjoined by space, hyphen, or just stuck together without either to make a closed compound word.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
word_orders <- function(words) {
  stopifnot(length(words) > 0)
  
  if (length(words) == 1) {
    res <- list(words)
  }
  else {
    res <- list()
    for (i in seq_along(words)) {
      next_list <- word_orders(words[-i])
      
      for (ws in next_list) {
        vec <- c(words[i], "-", ws)
        res <- c(res, list(vec))
      }
      
      for (ws in next_list) {
        vec <- c(words[i], " ", ws)
        res <- c(res, list(vec))
      }
      
      for (ws in next_list) {
        vec <- c(words[i], ws)
        res <- c(res, list(vec))
      }
    }
  }
  
  res
}
```


```{r}
res <- word_orders(c("evidence", "based", "policy", "making"))
length(res)
```

```{r}
res |>
  map_chr(\(x) paste(x, collapse = "")) |>
  walk(\(x) {
    cat(x)
    cat("\n")
  })
```
