Entanglement is the weirdest feature of quantum mechanics. David Mermin (1981) provides an accessible introduction to experiments showing that local determinism doesn't hold in the quantum world. This post shows the sums in R. It's probably only going to make sense if you have been here before, but hadn't got around to doing the sums yourself (that was me, before writing this today!).

I'm not going to attempt to explain what Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and Bell and others did or didn't say. Good luck wading into the lit.

First, a diagram of the setup (Mermin, 1981, p. 400):

![](mermin_device.png)


We have a device, *C*, that fires out two entangled particles to detectors *A* and *B*. The detectors have three measurement settings, 1, 2, and 3, and two lights, red (R) and green (G), which indicate the measurement outcome. *A* and *B* do not communicate with each other in any way and it is assumed that the measurement settings are independent of each other.

If you can read bra--ket notation, then the quantum state of the particles fired out by *C* is as follows:


$$|\psi\rangle = \frac{|RR\rangle + |GG\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$

What this means in words is that when the measurement settings on *A* and *B* are the same, e.g., both 1 or both 2, then the same lights always flash on *A* and *B* when the particles arrive. They are either both red or both green, with equal probability. If the measurement settings are different, sometimes the lights flash the same colour and other times they flash different colours.

One way to make this work is to assume the particles somehow encode what the measurement outcome will be for each of the three settings (local determinism). The particles heading left and right would then encode the same information. We can write this as a three-character string. *RGR* would denote that the outcome is red for setting 1, green for setting 2, and red for setting 3.

In this way, it's easy to see that the same light will flash at the two detectors when the measurement settings are the same.

Now suppose each measurement setting is chosen randomly with equal probability and the settings at *A* and *B* are independent. What happens when the settings are different?

Here's the setup. `a` and `b` give the measurement settings at *A* and *B*. `o1`, `o2`, and `o3`, give the outcome for the three measurement settings (so concatenating them together gives the three-character string). The R code below generates all 72 possibilities from the $2^3 = 8$ possible particle setups and the $3^2 = 9$ different combinations of measurement settings at *A* and *B*.

```{r}
dat <- expand.grid(
  a = 1:3,
  b = 1:3,
  o1 = c("R", "G"),
  o2 = c("R", "G"),
  o3 = c("R", "G")
) |>
  mutate(A = case_when(a == 1 ~ o1,
                       a == 2 ~ o2,
                       a == 3 ~ o3),
         B = case_when(b == 1 ~ o1,
                       b == 2 ~ o2,
                       b == 3 ~ o3),
         same = A == B)
dat
```

Now we can see how the probability of getting the same outcome depends on whether the measurement settings are the same:

```{r}
dat |>
  group_by(a == b) |>
  summarise(`P(Same outcome)` = mean(same))
```

The outcomes are always the same if the settings are the same and have a 50--50 chance of being the same if the settings are different.

Across all runs, the probability that the outcomes are the same is $2/3$:

```{r}
dat |>
  summarise(`P(Same outcome)` = mean(same))
```

This differs from the empirical findings from actual experiments, suggesting that something else is going on.

Let's view the entangled particles fired from *C* as qubits (abstracting from Mermin's discussion of Stern--Gerlach magnets). The measurement settings of *A* and *B* are then implemented as rotating the qubit entering the detector about the y-axis by using an [RY gate](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.RYGate.html), before measuring it.

Here's a quantum circuit with example settings:

![](mermin_qiskit.png)

The probability that the outcomes are the same at *A* and *B* is given by $\cos^2(\theta/2)$, where $\theta$ is the difference in between angles of rotations at *A* and *B*. (We're squaring because Born rule.)

Following Mermin (1981), we choose angles $0^{\circ}$, $-120^{\circ}$, and $120^{\circ}$ for the three measurement settings. `ang_diff` gives the difference in the angles (in degrees; `ang_diff_rads` is the same in radians).

Here is a table of the outcomes:

```{r}
dat_actual <- expand.grid(a = c(-120,0,120), b = c(-120,0,120)) |>
  mutate(ang_diff          = b - a,
         ang_diff_rads     = (ang_diff/360) * 2 * pi,
         `P(Same outcome)` = cos(ang_diff_rads/2)^2)
dat_actual
```

When the settings are the same at *A* and *B*, the findings agree with local determinism: the lights always flash the same colour. However, when the settings are different, the lights are the same on only $1/4$ of trials. This is lower than the $1/2$ predicted by the local determinism setup.

```{r}
dat_actual |>
  group_by(a == b) |>
  summarise(`P(Same outcome)` = mean(`P(Same outcome)`))
```

Hossenfelder and Palmer (2020) would want to emphasise that the falsification of local determinism assumes that the measurement settings are statistically independent, which they argue isn't obviously true. Allowing the measurement settings to be correlated is known as *superdeterminism*.
