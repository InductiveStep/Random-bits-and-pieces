LLM fails:

```{r}
library(MatchIt)

# Load the data
data(lalonde)

# Estimate the propensity score model
ps <- glm(treat ~ age + educ + race + married + nodegree, data = lalonde, family = "binomial")

# Choose a kernel function and bandwidth
kernel <- "epanechnikov"
bw <- 0.1

# Run the kernel matching algorithm
matched <- matchit(treat ~ ps, data = lalonde, method = "kernel", kernel = kernel, bw = bw)

# Assess the balance of the covariates after matching
summary(matched)
```
