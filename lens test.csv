Supporting thinking on sample sizes for thematic analyses: a quantitative tool,"Thematic analysis is frequently used to analyse qualitative data in psychology, healthcare, social research and beyond. An important stage in planning a study is determining how large a sample size may be required, however current guidelines for thematic analysis are varied, ranging from around 2 to over 400 and it is unclear how to choose a value from the space in between. Some guidance can also not be applied prospectively. This paper introduces a tool to help users think about what would be a useful sample size for their particular context when investigating patterns across participants. The calculation depends on (a) the expected population theme prevalence of the least prevalent theme, derived either from prior knowledge or based on the prevalence of the rarest themes considered worth uncovering, e.g. 1 in 10, 1 in 100; (b) the number of desired instances of the theme; and (c) the power of the study. An adequately powered study will have a high likelihood of finding sufficient themes of the desired prevalence. This calculation can then be used alongside other considerations. We illustrate how to use the method to calculate sample size before starting a study and achieved power given a sample size, providing tables of answers and code for use in the free software, R. Sample sizes are comparable to those found in the literature, for example to have 80% power to detect two instances of a theme with 10% prevalence, 29 participants are required. Increasing power, increasing the number of instances or decreasing prevalence increases the sample size needed. We do not propose this as a ritualistic requirement for study design, but rather as a pragmatic supporting tool to help plan studies using thematic analysis.",Methods
Should trans people be postmodernist in the streets but positivist in the spreadsheets? A reply to Sullivan,"Accurate census data is essential for a variety of government planning functions and plays an important methodological role in social science. This article responds to issues raised by Alice Sullivan concerning how the UK 2021 census will ask about sex and gender. The two-centuries-old question about male/female sex is not ideal, even with the new guidance proposed; however, I will argue that the proposed changes are unlikely to cause harm. The new open-ended census question on gender identity is welcome and will yield important data. I also respond to Sullivan‘s worries that “queer postmodernists” are “coming for” questionnaires and threaten the sanctity of scientific fact. Sullivan misrepresents trans-inclusive gender theories and how scientific research explaining sex/gender differences is carried out. Finally, I discuss how questioning the ontological reality of trans gender identities leads to transphobic harassment and worse.",Gender
A process model of the understanding of uncertain conditionals,"To build a process model of the understanding of conditionals we extract a common core of three semantics of if-then sentences: (a) the conditional event interpretation in the coherencebased probability logic, (b) the discourse processingtheory of Hans Kamp, and (c) the game-theoretical approach of Jaakko Hintikka. The empirical part reports three experiments in which each participant assessed the probability of 52 if-then sentencesin a truth table task. Each experiment included a second task: An n-back task relating the interpretation of conditionals to working memory, a Bayesian bookbag and poker chip task relating the interpretation of conditionals to probability updating, and a probabilistic modus ponens task relating the interpretation of conditionals to a classical inference task. Data analysis shows that the way in which the conditionals are interpreted correlates with each of the supplementary tasks. The results are discussed within the process model proposed in the introduction.",Reasoning
Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of humanistic counselling in schools for young people with emotional distress (ETHOS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background
One in ten children in Britain have been identified as experiencing a diagnosable mental health disorder. School-based humanistic counselling (SBHC) may help young people identify, address, and overcome psychological distress. Data from four pilot trials suggest that SBHC may be clinically effective. However, a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to provide a robust test of its effectiveness, to assess its cost-effectiveness, and to determine the process of change.

Methods/design
The Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness Trial of Humanistic Counselling in Schools (ETHOS) is a two-arm, parallel-group RCT comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of SBHC with Pastoral Care as Usual (PCAU) in school settings. Eligibility criteria for young people include being between 13 and 16 years of age and experiencing moderate to severe levels of emotional distress. Participants are randomised to receive either SBHC or PCAU. SBHC is delivered in up to 10 weekly, individual sessions in their school with a qualified, experienced counsellor who has also received training using a clinical practice manual. Adherence to the SBHC model is assessed by a sub-team of auditors and in clinical supervision. PCAU consists of the schools’ pre-existing systems for supporting the emotional health and well-being of students. The primary outcomes are psychological distress measured using the Young Person’s Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (YP-CORE) and costs evaluated using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI). Secondary outcomes include psychological difficulties, levels of depression, anxiety and self-esteem, well-being, school engagement, educational outcomes and achievement of personal goals. Qualitative interviews with participants, parents and school staff will look to identify the mechanisms of change in SBHC. Researchers administering the measures are blind to allocation. The trial requires n = 306 participants (n = 153 in each group), with 90% power to detect a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.5. An intention-to-treat analysis will be undertaken.

Discussion
This RCT is powered to detect clinically meaningful differences, and will make a major contribution to the evidence base for mental health provision for adolescents. It will have implications for all stakeholders, including policy-makers, statutory advisory bodies for child welfare, head teachers, children and young people practitioners, child welfare and parenting organisations, and young people.

More haste less speed: A meta-analysis of thinking latencies during planning in people with psychosis,"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of psychosis, with slowed processing speed thought to be a prominent impairment in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis. However, findings from the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) planning task suggest changes in processing speed associated with the illness may include faster responses in early stages of planning, though findings are inconsistent. This review uses meta-analytic methods to assess thinking times in psychosis across the available literature. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria: 1) included a sample of people with non-affective psychosis according to DSM III, DSM IV, DSM V or ICD-10 criteria; 2) employed the SOC task; 3) included a healthy control group; and 4) published in English. We identified 11 studies that employed the SOC task. Results show that people with psychosis have significantly faster initial thinking times than non-clinical participants, but significantly slower subsequent thinking times during problem execution. These findings indicate that differences in processing speed are not limited to slower responses in people with psychosis but may reflect a preference for step-by-step processing rather than planning before task execution. We suggest this style of responding is adopted to compensate for working memory impairment.",Mental Health
Associations between family and clinician ratings of child mental health: A study of UK CAMHS assessments and outcomes,"Background: The rated severity of child mental health problems depends on who is doing the rating, whether child, carer or clinician. It is important to know how these ratings relate to each other.

Aims: To investigate to what extent clinicians' views are associated with carers' and young people's views in routine care in the United Kingdom.

Method: Ratings of clinician and parent/child viewpoints from a large Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) sample ( ns 1773-47,299), as measured by the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) respectively, were analysed. The parent SDQ added value score (AVS), which adjusts for regression to the mean and other non-treatment change, was also included in the analyses.

Results: Small-to-medium correlations were found between family and clinician ratings; however, ratings diverged for the lowest-function CGAS bands. Regression analyses showed that pro-social ratings from both child and parent contributed to clinician ratings. Knowing child-reported emotional problem severity made parent ratings of emotions irrelevant to clinician judgements. There was a positive association between SDQ AVS and CGAS; as hypothesised, CGAS showed more change than the SDQ AVS, suggesting that clinicians over-estimate change.

Conclusion: This study shows the importance of multi-informant data gathering and the integration of multiple views by clinicians when monitoring outcomes.",Mental Health
