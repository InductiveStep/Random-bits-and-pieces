This post shows four ways to calculate the conditional probability that I have an umbrella, given that it's raining, $P(umbrella|raining)$. The first way uses the ratio formula, $P(raining \land umbrella)/P(raining)$. The second uses a three-valued logical connective, the conditional event, which can be traced back to the work of Bruno de Finetti in the 1930s (see, e.g., Baratgin, 2021). The third filters the dataset to rows where it's raining before counting the proportion of those where I had an umbrella. The fourth uses logistic regression.

Here's a simulated dataset about rain and umbrellas, where each row is a day.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(conflicted)
library(tidyverse)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
```

```{r}
days_n <- 20
set.seed(5)
```

```{r}
sim_dat <- data.frame(day = 1:days_n, raining = rbinom(days_n, 1, .5)) |>
  mutate(umbrella = rbinom(days_n, 1, ifelse(raining, .8, .2))) |>
  mutate(across(raining:umbrella, as.logical))
sim_dat
```

The variable _raining_ denotes whether it was raining and _umbrella_ denotes whether I had an umbrella with me.

Here are the joint probabilities:

```{r}
joints <- sim_dat |>
  group_by(raining, umbrella) |>
  tally() |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) |>
  select(-n) |>
  arrange(desc(raining), desc(umbrella))
joints
```

Then 

$$P(umbrella|raining) = \frac{P(raining \land umbrella)}{P(raining)}$$

$P(raining \land umbrella)$, i.e., the probability that it's raining _and_ I have an umbrella, is:

```{r}
raining_and_umbrella_p <- joints |>
  filter(raining & umbrella) |>
  pull(p)
raining_and_umbrella_p 
```

$P(raining)$ is:

```{r}
raining_p <- joints |>
  filter(raining) |>
  pull(p) |>
  sum()
raining_p
```

So, $P(umbrella|raining)$ is:

```{r}
raining_and_umbrella_p / raining_p
```

Another way to calculate this is using the _conditional event_, $B \dashv A$ ("B given A"), here using Hailperin's (1996) formulation (he calls it the _suppositional_):

```{r}
dont_care <- function(x)
  ifelse(x, NA, x)

`%-|%` <- function(y, x)
  dont_care(!x) | (x & y)
```

The _don't_care_ function has one parameter and returns the missing value, _NA_, if that parameter is _TRUE_. $B \dashv A$ is then defined using this so it gets the value _NA_ if $A$ is _FALSE_, otherwise it's equal to $A \land B$. Here's a table:

```{r}
vals <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
expand.grid(A = vals, B = vals) |>
  mutate(`B -| A` = B %-|% A) |>
  arrange(desc(A), desc(B))
```


We can apply this to the original dataset:

```{r}
sim_dat <- sim_dat |>
  mutate(`umbrella -| raining` = umbrella %-|% raining)
sim_dat
```


Now for $P(umbrella|raining)$ we drop the NAs and count the proportion of the time that $umbrella \dashv raining$ is TRUE:

```{r}
sim_dat |>
  pull(`umbrella -| raining`) |>
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

An easier, though less fun, way would be just:

```{r}
sim_dat |>
  filter(raining) |>
  pull(umbrella) |>
  mean()
```

Finally, we could use logistic regresion:

```{r}
logistic <- glm(umbrella ~ raining, data = sim_dat, family = binomial)
predict(logistic, newdat = data.frame(raining = TRUE), type = "response")
```
