Include the packages we need:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ivreg)
```

Simulate some data:

```{r}
the_n <- 10000
dat <- tibble(
  mot   = rbinom(the_n, 1, .7),
  treat = rbinom(the_n, 1, .5),
  comp  = treat * mot * rbinom(the_n, 1, .5),
  y     = 2 * mot + .4 * comp + rnorm(the_n, 0, 1)
)
```

Estimate the ATE under ITT.

```{r}
itt_mod <- lm(y ~ treat, data = dat)
summary(itt_mod)
```

Let's see what the association is between compliance and outcome:

```{r}
mod <- lm(y ~ comp, data = dat)
summary(mod)
```

How about trying ATE again but this time excluding anyone who didn't comply from the treat group:

```{r}
comp_dat <- dat %>%
  filter(comp == 1 | treat == 0) 

mod <- lm(y ~ treat, data = comp_dat)
summary(mod)
```

Now, 2SLS:

```{r}
iv <- ivreg(y ~ comp | treat, data = dat)
summary(iv)
```
