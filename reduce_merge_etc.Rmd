```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
set.seed(20250104)
A <- data.frame(id = 1:3, x = rnorm(3))
B <- data.frame(id = c(2, 3), y = rnorm(2))
C <- data.frame(id = c(1, 3), z = rnorm(2))
```

```{r}
A
B
C
```

Alexander Krannich's [example](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-krannich_rstats-statistics-rstudio-activity-7281670805879459840-zVZO):

```{r}
list(A, B, C) |>
  reduce(full_join, by = "id")
```

Using only {base}:

```{r}
list(A, B, C) |>
  Reduce(\(x, y) merge(x, y, by = "id", all = T), x = _)
```

Getting silly -- this all reminded me of Haskell's _foldr1_, implemented (without the Currying) as:

```{r}
foldr1 <- \(f, xs) {
  if (length(xs) == 1)
    xs[[1]]
  else
    f(xs[[1]], foldr1(f, tail(xs, length(xs) - 1)))
}

foldr1(\(x, y) merge(x, y, by = "id", all = T), list(A, B, C))
```

Here is an easier example:

```{r}
foldr1(`+`, 1:10)
```

Which is the same as:

```{r}
sum(1:10)
```
